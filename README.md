# Road Race

Welcome to **Road Race**, a high-speed racing game built with Rust. The game challenges players to maneuver through a bustling road, dodge obstacles, and reach the highest score possible. It's a great demonstration of Rust's power and efficiency in handling game mechanics and performance-critical code.

- **Smooth Controls**: Responsive controls for an enjoyable racing experience.
- **High Performance**: Built using Rust, offering efficient memory management and speed.
- **Random Obstacles**: Obstacles appear randomly, keeping each race unique and challenging.
- **Scoring System**: Track your score to see how far you can go without crashing!

## Updates
